-- For the time being I've given Administrators access all areas
-- Friends have Insert access to Items and read access to everything else
-- We also want to allow owners to amend their personal details and listings but first need to understand how this fits in with current_user/authentication
-- Script below also creates a test admin and test friend account, and assigns a role to each
