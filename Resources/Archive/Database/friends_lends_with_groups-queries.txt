Here are some queries for the new databse, this joins the many to many tables.  You should be able to just change some of the 
parameters to reurn different results, for example in the last query just change the name AMY for another name (will have to be one thats in 
a group)

--Brings up user names of the group uni friends

SELECT Username FROM `groups`
INNER JOIN link_users_groups ON link_users_groups.Groups_FK = Groups_ID
INNER JOIN users ON users.users_id = link_users_groups.Users_FK
where Group_name = "uni friends"


--Returns firstname, user name and group name for uni group members

SELECT FirstName,Username,Group_name FROM `groups`
INNER JOIN link_users_groups ON link_users_groups.Groups_FK = Groups_ID
INNER JOIN users ON users.users_id = link_users_groups.Users_FK where Group_name = "uni friends"


--Returns firstname, user name and group name for uni group members using 'like'

SELECT FirstName,Username,Group_name FROM `groups`
INNER JOIN link_users_groups ON link_users_groups.Groups_FK = Groups_ID
INNER JOIN users ON users.users_id = link_users_groups.Users_FK where Group_name LIKE '%uni%'


--Returns groups that Amy is a member of

SELECT FirstName,Username,Group_name FROM `groups` 
INNER JOIN link_users_groups ON link_users_groups.Groups_FK = Groups_ID
INNER JOIN users ON users.users_id = link_users_groups.Users_FK where Firstname = 'Amy'
