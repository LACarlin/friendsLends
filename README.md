FriendsLends Library Project

FriendsLends is a library aimed at a group of friends. The items in the library can be anything that the friends possess that they would be willing to lend each other - a physical object, a person, a pet, a skill, etc.

Steps to create the current working copy are:
1) Create a new empty database called FriendsLends in myphpadmin
2) Import "github/Resources/FriendsLends with Login/Database/Copy of Database/FriendsLends.sql" into the empty database
3) Import the files itempath.csv and userpath.csv from "github/Resources/CSV files to import pic paths" (there's a separate readme in the folder they're in with instructions on how to import
4) Pull down the shared Netbeans project FriendsLendsInProgress.  Make a local copy of this in Netbeans to use as your personal working copy.  Once you're happy any changes you make in your local copy, copy the updated files to the shared project and push the change up to Git so that we can all pull the change down.
