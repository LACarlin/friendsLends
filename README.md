FriendsLends Library Project

FriendsLends is a library aimed at a group of friends. The items in the library can be anything that the friends possess that they would be willing to lend each other - a physical object, a person, a pet, a skill, etc.

Steps to create the current working copy are:
1) Create a new empty database called FriendsLends in myphpadmin
2) Import "github/Resources/FriendsLends with Login/Database/Copy of Database/FriendsLends.sql" into the empty database
3) Import the Netbeans project from "github/Resources/FriendsLends with Login/Netbeans Export/FriendsLends.zip"
4) Run 'login.php' from Netbeans
